    <h1 id="lfth">CATARACT <br><br></h1> <br><br>   
    <p>Cataract is the most common disorder known to mankind. Cataract surgeries are the most commonly performed surgeries in the world. <br><br>

    Cataract is truly not a disease but an age-related change that occurs in the eye.<br><br>

    Just like a lens in a camera focuses objects, the lens inside the eye acts similarly. The lens is a clear, glass-like structure when we are young, and when we age, this clear lens turns opaque resulting in poor vision. This is cataract.<br><br>

    The average age a person develops cataract is around 60 to 75 years of age. However, cataract can develop even earlier or later.<br><br>

    The only modality of treatment for cataract is surgery. But, the timing of surgery is flexible. One need not wait for the cataract to be complete (mature) to plan for surgery. Surgery is necessary when the vision is not up to one’s satisfaction. Modern cataract surgery involves removal of the cataract through a 2mm incision and replacing it with an artificial lens (IOL).</p>

    <h1>DRY EYES</h1><br> </div>   
    <p>Tears normally coat the surface of the eyes to keep them moist and comfortable. When tears are poor in quantity or quality, it causes dry eyes. Dry eyes usually present with gritty sensation, burning, redness and discomfort in the eyes. Ironically watering of eyes is also a symptom of dry eyes. This occurs because the dry surface of the eyes stimulates the nerves to reflexly cause tearing..<br><br>

Normally when we blink, the eyelids close and replenish the normal tear film by draining away the old tear film. Also on blinking, around 30 to 40 glands located in the eyelids secrete oily secretions to stabilize the tear film. The average blink rate in an infant is around 8 to 12 blinks a minute and as we age the blink rate drops to around 4 to 6 blinks per minute. In between blinks, when the eye remains exposed to the atmosphere, the tear film dries up resulting in symptoms of dry eyes. <br><br>

When viewing any object with interest, subconsciously the blink rates further decrease to 1 to 2 times a minute. This results in poor blinking or habitual “half blinking”. This worsens symptoms of dry eyes and also retains the secretions of the gland. This in the long run results in loss of function of the glands and ultimately death of the glands. This is called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. This accounts for 86% of the causes for dry eyes. <br><br>

Normally, our eyes are comfortable looking down to read a book, than, to look at a computer monitor at or above the eye level exposing more surface area of the eye to the atmospheric environment contributing to dry eyes. In an air conditioned environment, the eyes dry up faster.</p>

    <h1 id="lfth">CONTACT LENSES <br><br></h1> <br><br>   
    <p>These thin plastic discs correct, improve all types of defective vision.They are also used for bandaging the eye after surgery and for cosmetic purposes to change the colour of the eye. They come as Rigid and soft lenses with varying levels of oxygen permeability- the greater the permeability the better. <br><br></p>
    <h3>Types of contact lenses</h3>
    <p>Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) : Lenses are semi-rigid lenses made usually from acrylate and fluorosilicone, a plastic which allow oxygen through to the eye. They are clinically the best as they allow maximum oxygen to reach the cornea being smaller in size. They are easy to care for, durable and give good clarity of vision. They can be prescribed for all types of vision correction, including high astigmatism, bifocals, post surgery (RK, PRK,& LASIK), therapeutic, and cosmetic for all age groups. In certain cases these lenses are also prescribed for myopia control. <br><br>

Soft lenses : Soft lenses are made from water- absorbing plastics, which make them pliable and membrane-like for maximum comfort. They are ideal for sports as they cannot be easily dislodged from the eye.    <br><br>

New silicon based soft lenses allow maximum oxygen to the cornea, enabling overnight continuous wear safely for a month. With modern manufacturing techniques, soft lenses can be made to correct all types of refractive errors and many types of lifestyles. Soft lenses are available in toric (to correct astigmatism), bifocal, weekly disposable, monthly disposable, daily disposable, extended wear and cosmetic to cover corneal scars, as well as to change the colour of one’s eyes for fashion. <br><br>

Irrespective of the type all lenses accumulate deposits from the secretions of the eye and the environment. All soft lenses are contaminated within 24 hours, when not in the eye, due to the water contained in the material. This makes contact lens care of vital importance. <br><br>

    <h1>GLAUCOMA</h1><br> </div>   
    <p>The eye is a fluid filled structure. The fluid inside the eyegives a normal pressure to the eye. The increase in eye pressure due to various reasons damages the nerve of the eye (optic nerve). This is glaucoma. Glaucoma is often a silent disorder which does not give rise to any symptoms during the early stages. <br><br> Very rarely symptoms such as pain and redness can occur. Glaucoma is the silent thief of vision. This will lead to slow, painless and progressive reduction of vision. This reduction of vision starts from the sides and progresses to the center over months and years (i.e. side/peripheral vision is lost first). <br><br>

What should be remembered is that the loss of vision due to glaucoma cannot be regained. So it is important that glaucoma is diagnosed during the early stages even before it causes any loss of vision. Glaucoma being a silent disorder, the early detection is possible only by routine eye examination. <br><br>
Most often glaucoma occurs after the age of 40 years. But rarely glaucoma can occur in children and young people. Since glaucoma is more common after 40 years, everybody more than 40 years should have a yearly eye test done. <br><br>

The standard tests for glaucoma include eye pressure (intraocular pressure-IOP)test and computerized visual field analysis to know the extent of peripheral vision (HFA). Uma eye clinic offers state of the art diagnostic facilities like ORA(Ocular Response Analyser) and OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography)which can image and study the optic nerve with micron accuracy. The most recent OCT-angiovue (angiogram without injection of dye) was introduced to India by Uma Eye Clinic. It images the blood flow to the optic nerve and helps to diagnose glaucoma at a very early stage even when all the other tests are normal. <br><br>

    <h1 id="lfth">CORNEAL GRAFTING<br><br></h1> <br><br>   
    <p>Cornea is the outer layer of the eye which helps focus and transmit light through the lens onto the retina. When the cornea is damaged beyond repair transplanting a donated cornea becomes a necessity. The cornea harvested after the donor's death is screened for infectious diseases before grafting.<br><br>
</p>

<h3> Causes for damage <br><br> </h3>
<p> => Congenital abnormalities <br>
=> Childhood infections like measles  <br>
=> Severe trauma  <br>
=> Degenerative diseases due to exposure to harsh light  <br></p>

    <h1>LASIK</h1><br> </div>   
    <p>Individuals wearing glasses to see clearly can have their glasses removed and have perfect vision without glasses. Different treatment options are available depending on the power of the glass (refractive error) and age of the patient. If a person is above 18 years of age and is wearing glasses or contact lenses, he/she can choose to have freedom from glasses/ contact lenses. This treatment is not done before 18 years of age as the glass power usually stabilizes around the age of 16 years. The most common and popular treatment is laser vision correction. In this treatment, the corneal curvature is changed to correct the patient’s refractive error (power of the glass) <br><br>

LASIK (Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis) is a quick, safe and accurate procedure to correct refractive errors. LASIK corrects refractive errors by reshaping the cornea with the help of Excimer laser with submicron accuracy with a very high success rate and good patient satisfaction. <br><br>
